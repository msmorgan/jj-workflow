# jj-workflow

A toolkit for multi-workspace [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) development.
It enforces trunk immutability, routes all jj calls through a workspace-pinned wrapper,
and manages a claim→integrate feature lifecycle where each in-flight feature lives in
its own isolated workspace.

## Installation

```bash
# Symlink mode — updates to jj-workflow propagate to your repo automatically.
./install.fish /path/to/your/repo

# Copy mode — independent copies; upgrade by re-running.
./install.fish --copy /path/to/your/repo
```

This installs into `your-repo/scripts/`:

```
scripts/
  jj                          ← workspace-pinned jj wrapper
  workflow                    ← claim/integrate lifecycle manager
  conflicts                   ← conflict inspector + resolver
  todo                        ← ticket dependency graph
  hooks/
    jj_guard.fish             ← Claude Code PreToolUse guard
  lib/
    setup.fish                ← shared sourcing helpers
    todo_graph.pl             ← dependency graph engine
```

**Manual follow-ups after install:**

1. Register `scripts/hooks/jj_guard.fish` as a Claude Code PreToolUse(Bash) hook in
   `.claude/settings.json` (see [The jj_guard hook](#the-jj_guard-hook)).
2. Copy `jjworkflow.example.toml` → `jjworkflow.toml` and edit if defaults don't fit.
3. Add a `scripts/provision-workspace` executable if new workspaces need shared or
   generated directories (see [Appendix](#appendix-example-provision-workspace-hook)).

---

## Repository shape

The toolkit expects one `default` workspace (the coordinator) plus any number of feature
workspaces, each a sibling directory at the same level:

```
../
  default/          ← coordinator; run scripts/workflow from here
  feature-a/        ← feature workspace (created by claim/start)
  feature-b/
  .integrated/      ← archived workspaces after integrate
  .abandoned/       ← archived workspaces after abandon
```

---

## The `scripts/jj` wrapper

**Always run jj through `scripts/jj` — never bare `jj`, `command jj`, or `git`.**

The wrapper does three things:

1. **Workspace pinning.** Passes `-R $project_dir` to every jj invocation, so scripts
   running from any working directory always address the correct workspace.

2. **Trunk immutability (outside `default`).** In any workspace other than `default`,
   it sets `immutable_heads() = default@-` — the last committed point on the default
   line. jj then refuses, per-operation, any rebase/abandon/squash that would reach
   shared history or another feature's commits. Your own feature work (commits above
   your claim bookmark) stays freely rewritable. The `default` workspace is left
   unguarded so a human coordinator can always go in and fix things.

3. **Flag rejection.** The flags `--config`, `--config-file`, and `--ignore-immutable`
   are refused; they would bypass the guard.

---

## The `jj_guard` hook

`scripts/hooks/jj_guard.fish` is a Claude Code `PreToolUse(Bash)` hook that enforces
the routing rules for AI agents:

- **jj must be invoked via a relative `scripts/jj`** — `scripts/jj`, `./scripts/jj`,
  or `../<ws>/scripts/jj` (a sibling workspace). An absolute path or bare `jj` is
  refused: an absolute path silently targets the workspace the script lives in, not
  your current working directory.
- **`git` is banned outright.** This is a jj repository; git mutations corrupt or
  confuse the op log and working-copy state.

Register it in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "fish scripts/hooks/jj_guard.fish" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Exit 2 from the hook blocks the tool call with the error on stderr; exit 0 allows it.

## Feature workflow

`scripts/workflow` manages the full feature lifecycle. Run it from the `default`
workspace — except `repair`, `converge`, and `resolve`, which run from the affected
feature workspace.

### Claiming and starting features

```bash
# Claim a ticket and spin up a new workspace:
scripts/workflow claim TICKET_NAME

# Start an ad-hoc workspace with no ticket:
scripts/workflow start NAME

# Fold extra tickets into an already-running workspace's claim:
scripts/workflow claim TICKET_A TICKET_B --into NAME
```

`claim TICKET_NAME`:
- Moves the ticket file from its triage folder (`critical/`, `planned/`, or `maybe/`)
  into `docs/tickets/wip/`, inside a new claim commit bookmarked `NAME` on
  `default@`'s linear history.
- Creates the `../NAME` workspace.
- Runs the provision hook (if configured) to populate shared/generated directories.

`start NAME` does the same without a ticket — useful for exploratory or ad-hoc work.

`claim TICKET_A ... --into NAME` folds extra tickets into an existing workspace's
claim commit. The workspace goes stale (its parent was rewritten); run
`scripts/jj workspace update-stale` there before the next commit.

**Claim eagerly** — before any exploration, brainstorming, or spec work. This
establishes your baseline and provisions the workspace so builds and tests work
immediately.

### Integrating a feature

```bash
# Run from default:
scripts/workflow integrate NAME
```

`integrate` performs these steps in order:

1. **Refresh** — reorders NAME's claim commit to sit just under `default@`, carrying
   the feature stack and workspace working copy with it.
2. **Fold** — moves `default@` onto the feature tip.
3. **Complete** — moves the owned ticket(s) from `wip/` → `done/` in a final commit.
4. **Archive** — forgets the workspace and moves its directory to `../.integrated/`.

If a conflict arises during the refresh step, integrate stops (exit 2) and leaves the
conflict in place in `../NAME`. Resolve it there and re-run `integrate NAME`.

### Abandoning a feature

```bash
# Run from default:
scripts/workflow abandon NAME
```

Discards the feature, reverts every owned ticket back to its triage folder, and
archives the workspace to `../.abandoned/`. Op-restore safe: the claim commit's
abandonment rolls back the ticket moves automatically.

### Refreshing (keeping current with trunk)

```bash
# Refresh one workspace (run from default):
scripts/workflow refresh NAME

# Refresh all non-default workspaces — HUMAN OPERATOR ONLY:
scripts/workflow refresh --all
```

`refresh NAME` reorders NAME's claim commit to sit just under the current `default@`,
carrying the feature stack. A conflict is left in place for you to resolve — it does
not roll back.

> **`refresh --all` is human-only.** It rewrites every workspace's claim at once.
> Never run it as an AI agent: a concurrent `integrate` could fold a stale half into
> `default@`. AI agents touch only their own feature, via `refresh NAME` or
> `integrate NAME`.

---

## Ticket folders as status

Work items are markdown files under `docs/tickets/`, with the folder name as the status:

| Folder | Status |
|--------|--------|
| `critical/`, `planned/`, `maybe/` | Triage — claimable |
| `wip/` | Claimed — in-flight |
| `done/` | Integrated |

Each ticket file can carry `needs:` frontmatter listing dependency slugs. The
`scripts/todo` tool reads that graph without opening individual files:

```bash
scripts/todo ready           # items whose every dependency is in done/ (claimable now)
scripts/todo blocked         # items with at least one unmet dependency
scripts/todo graph SLUG      # upstream deps + downstream blockers for SLUG
scripts/todo check           # detect cycles and dangling dependency references
scripts/todo needs SLUG      # print SLUG's direct needs, one per line
```

Ticket moves happen inside jj commits, so `abandon` reverts them automatically:

- `claim`: ticket move is baked into the claim commit → `abandon` reverts it.
- `integrate`: ticket move to `done/` is baked into the completion commit.

## Recovery

Conflicts and working-copy divergences land in the feature workspace, never on trunk.
Three recovery commands run **from the affected feature workspace**:

### `repair` — one-stop recovery

```bash
cd ../NAME
scripts/workflow repair
```

The single entry point for "my branch shifted under me." In order:

1. Clears a stale working copy (`workspace update-stale`).
2. Heals a working-copy divergence if one is detected (`converge`).
3. Walks any refresh/integrate conflicts oldest-first (`resolve`).

**Exit codes:**

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Branch clean — re-integrate. |
| `1` | Stopped on a conflicted commit. Remove all markers from the files `jj st` lists, then re-run `repair`. |
| `2` | Needs a human — divergent halves hold genuinely different work, or a jj step rolled back. |

When `repair` stops on a conflict it calls `scripts/conflicts show` automatically and
prints the per-file resolution commands.

### `converge` — working-copy divergence

```bash
scripts/workflow converge
```

Heals a working-copy divergence: two or more commits sharing `@`'s change ID, left
when a concurrent op rewrote the workspace while it had un-snapshotted edits. Keeps
the half holding your work (identified by content — never by the `/N` index or a
commit hash), drops the rest in one atomic pass.

Refuses when two halves hold genuinely different work — that needs a human
(`jj edit` the right half, `jj abandon` the other).

### `resolve` — conflict walker

```bash
scripts/workflow resolve
```

Walks a feature stack's conflicts oldest-first after `refresh`/`integrate` left them.
Each invocation either:

- Drops you onto the oldest conflicted commit and exits 1 — remove every marker
  from the files `jj st` lists, then re-run.
- Folds your fix into that commit and advances to the next conflict.
- Exits 0 when the stack is clean — re-run `integrate NAME`.

A temporary `NAME-tip` bookmark tracks the real tip while you descend. It is
forgotten on exit 0.

---

## Conflicts tool

`scripts/conflicts` is a fast inspector and resolver for jj's native conflict marker
format (diff+snapshot style).

```bash
scripts/conflicts list                         # list all conflicted files
scripts/conflicts show [FILE ...]              # print conflict hunks with line numbers
scripts/conflicts show --json [FILE ...]       # structured JSON output per hunk
scripts/conflicts accept FILE snapshot         # accept +++ (literal snapshot) side
scripts/conflicts accept FILE diff             # accept %%% (diff-applied) side
scripts/conflicts accept FILE base             # accept the merge base
scripts/conflicts accept FILE stack            # stack both adds: diff first, then snapshot
scripts/conflicts accept FILE stack-snap-first # stack both adds: snapshot first
scripts/conflicts accept FILE sort             # merge alphabetized-list adds, re-sorted
scripts/conflicts auto [--dry-run] [FILE ...]  # auto-merge alphabetized-list conflicts
```

`show --json` includes a `stackable: true` field on hunks where both sides are pure
additions (no deletions) — useful for scripted resolution.

The `auto` subcommand resolves the most common conflict class automatically: when both
branches added lines to an already-sorted list (imports, dependency lists) and the region
is a sorted run of at least 3 lines, it merges both sides' additions and re-sorts — no
manual marker removal. It acts only when confident (both sides pure additions, base run
already sorted); any hunk that does not qualify is reported and left untouched, and `auto`
exits 0 even with hunks left, so it composes into `workflow repair`. Use `--dry-run` to
preview decisions without writing. `accept FILE sort` applies the same merge to one file
on demand.

## Configuration

Copy `jjworkflow.example.toml` → `jjworkflow.toml` in your repo root. All keys are
optional; a missing file uses the defaults shown:

```toml
# Executable run after a new workspace is created, with the workspace dir as $1.
# Default: scripts/provision-workspace
provision_hook = "scripts/provision-workspace"
```

> **v1 fixed conventions:** `trunk_workspace` (the trunk workspace name, `default`) and
> `tickets_root` (`docs/tickets`) are fixed in v1 and are not configurable via
> `jjworkflow.toml`. `provision_hook` is the only configurable key.

## Appendix: Example provision-workspace hook

When a project has shared gitignored directories each workspace needs — generated build
inputs, large data files, compiled artifacts — create `scripts/provision-workspace`.
The workflow toolkit runs it automatically during `claim`/`start`, passing the new
workspace directory as `$1`. Without a hook, provisioning is a no-op (fine for
source-only projects).

Here is a generic example that symlinks a shared `data/` directory from the `default`
checkout:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/provision-workspace
# Called by scripts/workflow claim/start after jj workspace add.
# $1 = the new workspace directory.
set -euo pipefail
ws_dir="$1"
default_dir="$(dirname "$ws_dir")/default"

# Symlink shared read-only data back to the default checkout.
# The symlink is excluded by .git/info/exclude in default (shared by all
# secondary workspaces), so no per-workspace exclude is needed.
ln -sfn "$default_dir/data" "$ws_dir/data"

echo "Provisioned: symlinked data/ in $ws_dir"
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/provision-workspace
```

The `.gitignore` entry for `data/` should use a **trailing slash** (`data/`) so it
matches the directory but not the symlink — the symlink form stays excluded via
`.git/info/exclude` in `default` (which is shared across all secondary workspaces
because they have no `.git` of their own).

Verify a newly provisioned workspace is clean:

```bash
scripts/jj st   # must report no changes
```
